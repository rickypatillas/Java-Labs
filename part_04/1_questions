Answer the following questions:

1) What is an array?
    -a collection of variables of the same type, referred to by a common name.

2) What the code required to create (instantiate) a String array with size 10 named "cats"?
    -int cat[] = new int [10];

3) What is a multidimensional array?
    -an array of arrays

4) What is the code required to create (instantiate) a 2-dimensional int array that is 6 high and 6 wide named "scores"?
    -int scores[][] = new int [6][6];

5) Using code, how do you retrieve a String that is the 10th item in a traditional array named dogs?
    -sting dogName = dog[9];

6) What is an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException?
    -a run-time error to overrun or underrun teh end of an array.
    -ex. if you create an array lenght 10th and thent ry to retrieve an item from teh 10th index creates IndexOutofBounds
    error because final index is 9.

7) Using one line of code, demonstrate how to retrieve the second to the last item from a int array.
    -int secondtoLast = arrayName[arrayName.lenght - 2];

8) What is the maximum allowable size of an array in Java?
    -2^31-1

9) What is a bubble sort?
    -a simple, basic sorting algorithm which oerates by making several passes though the array, exchanging
    out-of-place elements when necessary. The # of passes required to ensure that the array is sorted id =
    to 1 less than the number of elements in the array.
    -a very inefficinet sorting algorithm. Reuires a nested for loop. outer loop must rin as many times as the lenght of the lenght
    of collection - 1. Inner loop cmpares sequential pairs and swaps them if needed bbe. Depending on wehterh you are
    starting from the bottom or the top, the (next) smallest number will bubble to the top on each subsequent loop (or viceversa
    largest number bubbleto the bottom on each loop).

10) How does a bubble sort work?
    -see above ^^^

11) When might you use an irregular array? What is a good example of an irregular array?
    -even though teh use of irregular arrays is not recommended for mosmt applications, given that it runs contrary to what
    peple expect to find when a mulitdimensinal array is encountered. nevertheless, irregulars can be used effectively
    when you need very large two-dimensionals array sparcely populated.

12) Demonstrate how to iterate through an array, printing each value, using a for loop.
    - for(int i = 0; i < array.lenght; i++);
        sout(arrayName[i]);

13) Demonstrate how to iterate through an array, printing each value, using a while loop.
    - int i = 0;
    while(1 != array.lenght - 1) {
        sout(array[i]);
        i++;
    }

14) What is a queue?
    -a lsit in which elements are accessed in a first-in-first-out order.

15) What are the two primary methods that a queue performs?
    -put and get

16) What is a stack?
    -It's a list in which elements are accessed in first-in-first-out order

17) What differentiates stacks and queues?
filo vs fifo

18) When would you use an enhanced for loop?
    -when you want to iterate over every item in a collection and don't need access to the index

19) What is "The Collections Framework"? What classes does it include?
    -set of classes that implements vaiuos datastructures in java. It includes lists, vectors, sets and maps.

20) How do you iterate over a two-dimensional array? Demonstrate using psuedo code.
    - for (int [] x : nums) {       //assumes nums is a 2D array, ie. nums[][]
        for(int y : x) {
            sout(y);
            }
        }

   - for(int i = 0; i < nums.lenght; i++){
        for(int j = 0; j < nums[i].lenght; j++){
        sout(nums[i][j];
        }
      }

21) What is a String?
    -a datatype composed of words
    -object type it is not primitive type
    -a string of chars


22) What are a few common methods for operating on Strings?
    --String str = "hey My Name is";
    -int x = str.lengt();
    -str = str.replace("h", "H");
    str = str.subString(0, 6);

23) What does "Strings are immutable" mean?
    -cannot change them, eve if you are just adding one character to an existing string -  teh old string
    deleted and a new object is created

24) Using the CLI, how do you invoke a Java application and provide two parameters to the main method?
    -$javac ClassName.java
    -$java ClassName arg1 arg2
