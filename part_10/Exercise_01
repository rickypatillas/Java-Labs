Complete Exercise 4 in Chapter 12 self test.

-4. 	The traffic light simulation developed in Try This 12-1 can be improved with a few simple
 changes that take advantage of an enumerationâ€™s class features. In the version shown, the
 duration of each color was controlled by the TrafficLightSimulator class by hard-coding
 these values into the run( ) method. Change this so that the duration of each color is stored
 by the constants in the TrafficLightColor enumeration. To do this, you will need to add
 a constructor, a private instance variable, and a method called getDelay( ). After making
 these changes, what improvements do you see? On your own, can you think of other
 improvements? (Hint: Try using ordinal values to switch light colors rather than relying
 on a switch statement.)
