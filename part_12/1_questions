1) What is a lambda expression?

2) What is the general form of a lambda expression?

3) What is a functional interface?

4) Write a lambda expression that uses the following functional interface:

    interface SomeInterface {
        boolean validate(int a, int b);
    }

    // write lambda here as though it were in another class

5) Write a lambda expression that uses the following functional interface:

    interface GenericTest {
        boolean run(T a, T b);
    }

    // write lambda here as though it were in another class

6) Analyze and run the LambdaSpeedDemo.java file in the part_12 package. Understand the similarities between lambda expressions
and anonymous inner classes as well as interfaces (and interface implementations). Run this application and take a look at the results.
Change the number of loops for each test and see what happens. Which implementation is fastest? How did the lambda do?

7) What is variable capture?

8) How do you throw an exception from within a lambda expression?
