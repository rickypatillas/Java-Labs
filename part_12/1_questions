1) What is a lambda expression?

2) What is the general form of a lambda expression?

3) What is a functional interface?

4) Write a lambda expression that uses the following functional interface:

    interface SomeInterface {
        boolean validate(int a, int b);
    }

    // write lambda here as though it were in another class

5) Write a lambda expression that uses the following functional interface:

    interface GenericTest {
        boolean run(T a, T b);
    }

    // write lambda here as though it were in another class

6) Write a lambda expression (including functional interface) as well as a traditional interface and interface implementation
as well as an anonymous inner class. A three (the lambda, the interface implementation and the inner class) should do the EXACT
same task. Use "long start = System.currentTimeMillis();" to get the start time and end time of each operation. Compare and
contrast the three different approaches to running the same task and their speeds.


7) What is variable capture?

8) How do you throw an exception from within a lambda expression?
