Using MySQLWorkbench do the following

1) create a new blank database with the name "car_dealership"

2) create a new table named "clients" with the following fields:
    - id (auto increment)
    - userID (refers to "id" in users table)
    - carID (refers to "id" in cars table)
    - dealerID (refers to user in users table who is the car dealer)

2) create a new table named "users" with the following fields
    - id (auto increment)
    - first name
    - last name

3) create a new table named "cars" with the following fields
    - id (auto increment)
    - make
    - model
    - color
    - year

4) populate these tables with at least 5 records each - the more the merrier

5) Write the SQL queries to accomplish the following: (write each of your queries below for review)
    - select all records from clients
    - select all records from clients where car make = "Toyota"
    - use a join to select all makes and models that a dealer has sold
    - use a left join to select the first and last name of everyone who has bought a red car
    - use an insert statement to create a new record in each table
    - create a new table named "test" with at least two fields
    - use sql to drop the the "test" table
    - use sql to update a record in the "cars" table

6) Using MySQLWorkbench, export the the "clients", "users" and "cars" schema with all objects and data into a
self-contained sql file. - check the exported file into git
