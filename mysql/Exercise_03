Using MySQLWorkbench do the following

1) create a new blank database with the name "car_dealership"

2) create a new table named "users_cars" with the following fields:
    - id (auto increment)
    - userID (refers to "id" in users table)
    - carID (refers to "id" in cars table)


2) create a new table named "users" with the following fields
    - id (auto increment)
    - first name
    - last name

3) create a new table named "cars" with the following fields
    - id (auto increment)
    - make
    - model
    - color
    - year

4) populate these tables with at least 5 records each - the more the merrier

5) Write the SQL queries to accomplish the following: (write each of your queries below for review)
    - select all records from users
        select * from users
    - select all records from cars where car make = "Toyota"
         SELECT * FROM cars
           where make = 'toyota'
    - use a join to select the first name and car model of every user who has bought a car
        SELECT u.first_name as Name, c.make as Make
        from users u
        join users_car uc
        on uc.userid = u.id
        join cars c
        on uc.carID = c.id

    - use a join to select the first and last name of everyone who has bought a red car
        SELECT u.first_name as Name, u.last_name as LastName, c.color
        from users u
        join users_car uc
        on uc.userid = u.id
        join cars c
        on uc.carID = c.id
        where color = 'sexy red'

    - use an insert statement to create a new record in each table
    INSERT INTO cars (make, model, color, year)
    values ('Chevrolet', 'Camaro', 'Black', 2011)

    insert into users_car(userId, carID)
    values (9, 9)

    insert into users (first_name, last_name)
    values('Rosado', 'DeLaColina')


    - use sql to update a record in the "cars" table
        update cars
        set color = 'pink'
        where id = 4;

6) Using MySQLWorkbench, export the the "users_cars", "users" and "cars" schema with all objects and data into a
self-contained sql file. - check the exported file into git
